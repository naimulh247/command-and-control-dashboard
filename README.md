## **General Overview**
The Campus Rover Command & Control project is a critical component of the Campus Rover Project at Brandeis University, facilitating remote control between the operator and the robot. The system consists of three main components:
- **Web Application:** Built using React, serves as the user interface for controlling the robot. Supports teleoperation and camera feed, along with Progressive Web App (PWA).
- **ROS (Robot Operating System):** Manages the robot's operations.
- **rosbridge:** Enables communication between the web application and ROS.

### **Key Features:**
- Live camera feed
- Teleoperation controls
- GPS mapping and robot metrics

## **Goals**
### **Demo Goals:**
- Showcase a professional application for future students.
- Demonstrate working teleop control, live camera feed, GPS mapping, and robot metrics.

### **Learning Objectives:**
- Understand ROS core communication.
- Gain real-world project experience.

### **Evaluation Criteria:**
- Focus on convenience and understandability for users.
